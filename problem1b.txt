This is the same as problem1a, except that we add another plt.plot function where we plot microsoft's data with time. Looking at the stock prices at the time, we see that dates run through the depression of 2008 where all companies went through a major stock dip. We can notice this major difference in Apple's stock price which plummeted from 190 to 120 in a span of 3 months. A similar dip can be noticed in Microsoft albeit not very clearly in problem1b.png where the prices dropped from 36 to 27.
