The bins for the histogram in my code were just the number of days between the timeline.
This is because there were only 68 days and this was a number small enough to be represented 
efficienctly in the plot. By using strftime to remove the seconds and hours in the datetime,
we could get a large number of values in each of the bins. We could also have tried doing it by hour,
since the submission time is given in hour, but this would lead to an extremely large number of bins 
in the plot. Manually selecting the bins is also an option but it is highly complicated and
the results are not even much better than the ones we get from using the days as the bins.
