In this question, I read the file and store the stock prices of Apple and Microsoft in separate lists and also the month in a list and store it in datetime format. Now, we plot the Apple stocks along with the date using the matplotlib.pyplot's plot function. We use the stock month as the x-axis and the apple stock as the y-axis and plot as '.b-' which means that the plot will be a scatter plot and the '-' will connect the dots together to form a time series.
