It makes more sense for the data to be juxtaposed having the common X-axis because the value of the stocks are on different scales. This way, we can see a similar plot in the Microsoft and Apple stocks 
since they will now be scaled accordingly due to their different Y-axis. This makes for a better plot.
One more significant thing to notice is that even though Microsoft has split its shares more, which always leads to more volatility in prices, in problem1b.png, it appears that Apple has the more significant drop in prices even though it is Microsoft which in fact has the largest price drop. But, when we change the axis in the Y to compare the 2(Juxtapose), we notice this much more clearly.
One more thing to note is that Apple's shares did in fact fall drastically, which does not tend to happen since the value of the stocks are more, which leads to lesser volatility of price change. From the above graph, we can get a more unbiased view of the stock price change as compared to problem1b.png.
