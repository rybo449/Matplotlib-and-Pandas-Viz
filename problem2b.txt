We can clearly notice that assignment 3 is the one where most of the people submitted on the day of the deadline, which probably means that that assignment was the hardest. The other assignments after it had a more reasonably varied time which may mean that after assignment 3 people started working on the problem much earlier in order to avoid the disaster of that assignment. But, soon the amount of submissions near the deadline starts going up again which can be attributed to laziness. We also notice that most of the people submitted the first few assignments over reasoanbly large spaces. This probably means that people found those assignments easy, or just did their work ahead of time.
