The amount of work closest to the dealine is always the highest in the period of any assignment. This is the expected behavior and there is nothing suprising about this, but the data validates the hypothesis. The only assignments where the number of submissions were not the highest in the final day was the asignment 0 and assignment 1. This is probably because people finished their work ahead of time and did not want to wait till the last day before submitting.
Assignments 0&1 were probably easy too so people did not submit them multiple times as they did the other assignments. So, people must have submitted assignment 3 the most since it was probably the most difficult of them all. So, the graph shows 2 things, how difficult an assignment was and also how late people put off their assignments. It shows a steep learning jump at assignment 3 and it gets progressively easier after that but not as simple as assignment 0&1.
